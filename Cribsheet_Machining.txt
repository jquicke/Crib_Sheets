*Electric Motors*
1800 rpm motor provides more torque over 3600 rpm motor (torque over speed)
VFD = 1 phase in and 3 phase out

*Tool Bits*
de-magnitize tool bits using magnetic field generated between solder gun tip (magnet,magnets)

*Drill Sharpening*
135 degree for steel (67.5 degrees)
118 degree for non ferrous materials (59 degrees)
cutting edge needs relief (3 to 5 degrees)
check length of cutting edges and make sure they are equal

*Carbide Inserts*

TPU-322 Insert
shape - triangle 
insert clearance angle - 11 degree
tolerance +/- .003" insert size
tolerance +/- .003" thickness
size - 3/8"
thickness - 1/4"
nose radius - 1/32"

*Calculate Facemill Speeds*

Step 1) Calculate SFM (Surface Feet/Minute, which determines RPM:

SFM with HSS Endmills
Stainless Steel 40
Mild Steel 100
Brass 300
Aluminum 400

SFM with Uncoated Carbide Endmills, multiply those HSS setting by 3 (starting point)
Stainless Steel 120
Mild Steel 300
Brass 900
Aluminum 1200

SFM with Coated Carbide Endmills, multiply HSS settings by 4 (starting point)
Stainless Steel 160
Mild Steel 400
Brass 1200
Aluminum 1600

Step 2) calculate RPM:
RPM = 4 x SFM / Diameter of cutter head

Step 3) calculate chip load: A reasonable starting point for the chip load is to divide your endmill diameter by 200.
Chip Load = Diameter / 200

Step 4) calculate feed rate in IPM (inch per minute):
Feed Rate= RPM x Num of Teeth x Chip Load

Example: 1/4" HSS endmill in steel
RPM = 4 x 100/.25 = 1600
Feed Rate = 1600 x 2 x .25/200 = 4 IPM

Step 5) calculate slotting max radial and axial cut depth:
6061 Aluminum, Brass - 50% endmill diameter
7075 Aluminum - 40% endmill diameter
Mild Steel - 30-35% endmill diameter
Stainless Steel - 20-25% endmill diameter

Step 6) calculate plunging max radial and axial cut depth:
normal slotting feedrate divided by number of flutes

Step 7) calculate tool overlap:
rough overlap 70% endmill diameter or less
finish overlap 3% endmill diameter

*Calculate Lathe Spindle Speeds*
HSS Cutter
(Cutting Speed in FPM x 12) / (Dia. of Cut in inches x 3.14) = RPM
Carbide Cutter
((Cutting Speed in FPM * 2) x 12) / (Dia. of Cut in inches x 3.14) = RPM
